<h1>Future of Flutter Development</h1>
<p>As Flutter is still a new framework, established in May 2017, it still has the time to show its incredible capabilities.
While some people are still skeptical about it, many see this framework's real power and potential.</p>
<p>In this article today, we will explain the future of Flutter development. We made a list of 9 reasons why your business
should opt for such a developer and what kind of benefits you will gain.</p>
<h2>What is Flutter?</h2>
<p>Flutter is an open-source framework. This means that it’s accessible to anyone - anyone can see it, use it, and modify
it as they wish. This framework uses Dart as a programming language, and its biggest advantage is its cross-platform
feature.</p>
<p>Cross-platform means that the developer creates a single codebase for different operating systems and platforms. Long
story short - you don’t have to hire three different developers for one single app. Flutter will do all that!</p>
<p>Thanks to a single codebase, Flutter developers can create scalable, high-performance, applications with attractive and
functional UI for Android and iOS devices.</p>
<h2>Are companies using Flutter?</h2>
<p>Yes, many companies use Flutter developers widely around the world. Thus, the demand for Flutter development is raising
its bar each day. To be precise, according to Statista reports and their survey from 2021, Flutter is the most popular
cross-platform mobile framework.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the most popular apps is made with the Flutter framework, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alibaba</li>
<li>Google Ads</li>
<li>eBay Motors</li>
<li>Reflectly</li>
<li>Hamilton</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Should I Hire Flutter Developer?</h2>
<p><strong>Hire a Flutter developer</strong> if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need a mobile application for various operating systems and platforms;</li>
<li>You want a faster time-to-market;</li>
<li>You want to spend less time and money on testing;</li>
<li>You want a cost- and time-effective developing experience;</li>
<li>You want easy maintenance and updates on your apps;</li>
<li>You want an outstanding performance of your app;</li>
<li>You want exceptional credibility gained worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are still thinking, are Flutter developers in demand, here are ten reasons why these developers are the future!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Single codebase feature</strong><br>
Flutter uses a single codebase, which simplifies the whole app development process. This means that developers create
a single codebase that can be used for both iOS and Android platforms.</p>
<p>By creating an app with Flutter, you will reduce the developing time and the time to market. A single codebase also
reduces the amount of testing and maintenance required while increasing efficiency and productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reducing the time of app development</strong><br>
At some approximate time, developers will need around two to six months to develop your app, depending on the app's
complexity. No matter the case, the secret of the faster development time of Flutter is that it can be used for six
different platforms with one codebase. Also, the variety of widgets components can easily be updated and customized,
contributing to the overall efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reducing the cost of app development</strong><br>
Aside from reducing the time, Flutter reduces the app development cost. How? Well, instead of hiring three different
developers for three different platforms, one Flutter developer will finish all that work by himself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unlimited widgets</strong><br>
Flutter includes an incredible set of widgets for your app’s UI interface. And the best thing about this set of
widgets is that all of them are easily customizable and reusable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exceptional performances</strong><br>
Flutter is popular for its incredible performance and the ability to master it pretty quickly. Thanks to Dart - its
programming language, it features a high-speed frame rate.
This approach allows developers to reach a wider audience without significant costs. Additionally, it reduces the
time spent on development compared to developing separate apps for each platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hot Reload feature</strong><br>
Hot Reload is another incredible feature that the Flutter framework has. It means your developer can instantly change
and update your app and see the result. It is a feature that lets you place an updated source code into a running app
without waiting for the app to rebuild or relaunch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Automated testing</strong><br>
Application testing needs time and money investment. However, you can simplify and ease this work by using Flutter as
your cross-platform app development platform. Furthermore, automated testing, which Flutter features, allows developers
to quickly validate the app's usability, functionality, and user interface.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why is Flutter the Future of Mobile App Development?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growing demand for cross-platform frameworks</strong> - Flutter is a great option for businesses and developers searching
for methods to reach a broader audience. Also, it reduces development costs due to its ability to produce apps for many
platforms using a single codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Importance of mobile widgets</strong> - The role of widgets is becoming even more significant as the mobile app development
market grows. This makes Flutter a great choice for developers wishing to create creative, aesthetically appealing apps.</li>
<li><strong>Demand for Dart programming language</strong> - Dart is gaining popularity because of its simplicity and ease of usage.
Thus, more and more developers are opting for Flutter.</li>
<li><strong>The high growth of the Flutter community</strong> - The Flutter community is fast expanding and contributing to the
framework's progress. With more developers contributing to Flutter, additional features, tools, and libraries are
introduced, making Flutter more powerful and adaptable.</li>
<li><strong>Rise of the Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> - With a growing number of IoT devices, there is an increasing demand for
application developers who can build apps that can interface with these devices. Flutter's compatibility with numerous
devices and platforms makes it ideal for this application development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you are in doubt about whether to hire a Flutter developer or not, here’s your solution. If you want reduced time and
cost for creating your app with the highest performance and fast time to market, choose Flutter.
Its community is growing by the minute, with constant updates, assistance, and new practices. The future of Flutter
development is here, and it is in such demand that it is not going down but rather getting bigger every day.</p>
