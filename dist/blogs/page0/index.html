      <h2>Is Django Still Relevant in 2024?</h2>
      <p>As we progress into 2024, Django, the Python-based web framework, remains a robust and adaptable tool for modern web development. Despite critiques about its asynchronous support and static typing, Django has evolved to meet the needs of today&#39;s developers, with significant advancements such as async ORM and middleware. Its &quot;batteries-included&quot; philosophy, backward compatibility, scalability, and active community ensure that Django continues to thrive in the competitive landscape. While no framework is perfect, Django&#39;s strengths and ongoing modernization efforts affirm its relevance and utility in building high-performance web applications today.</p>
