# Future of Flutter Development 

As Flutter is still a new framework, established in May 2017, it still has the time to show its incredible capabilities.
While some people are still skeptical about it, many see this framework's real power and potential.

In this article today, we will explain the future of Flutter development. We made a list of 9 reasons why your business 
should opt for such a developer and what kind of benefits you will gain.

## What is Flutter?
Flutter is an open-source framework. This means that it’s accessible to anyone - anyone can see it, use it, and modify 
it as they wish. This framework uses Dart as a programming language, and its biggest advantage is its cross-platform 
feature.

Cross-platform means that the developer creates a single codebase for different operating systems and platforms. Long 
story short - you don’t have to hire three different developers for one single app. Flutter will do all that!

Thanks to a single codebase, Flutter developers can create scalable, high-performance, applications with attractive and 
functional UI for Android and iOS devices.

## Are companies using Flutter?
Yes, many companies use Flutter developers widely around the world. Thus, the demand for Flutter development is raising 
its bar each day. To be precise, according to Statista reports and their survey from 2021, Flutter is the most popular 
cross-platform mobile framework.

In fact, one of the most popular apps is made with the Flutter framework, including:

* Alibaba
* Google Ads
* eBay Motors
* Reflectly
* Hamilton

## Why Should I Hire Flutter Developer?
**Hire a Flutter developer** if:
* You need a mobile application for various operating systems and platforms;
* You want a faster time-to-market;
* You want to spend less time and money on testing;
* You want a cost- and time-effective developing experience;
* You want easy maintenance and updates on your apps;
* You want an outstanding performance of your app;
* You want exceptional credibility gained worldwide.

If you are still thinking, are Flutter developers in demand, here are ten reasons why these developers are the future!

1. **Single codebase feature**<br>
   Flutter uses a single codebase, which simplifies the whole app development process. This means that developers create
   a single codebase that can be used for both iOS and Android platforms.

   By creating an app with Flutter, you will reduce the developing time and the time to market. A single codebase also 
   reduces the amount of testing and maintenance required while increasing efficiency and productivity.
2. **Reducing the time of app development**<br>
   At some approximate time, developers will need around two to six months to develop your app, depending on the app's 
   complexity. No matter the case, the secret of the faster development time of Flutter is that it can be used for six 
   different platforms with one codebase. Also, the variety of widgets components can easily be updated and customized, 
   contributing to the overall efficiency.
3. **Reducing the cost of app development**<br>
   Aside from reducing the time, Flutter reduces the app development cost. How? Well, instead of hiring three different 
   developers for three different platforms, one Flutter developer will finish all that work by himself.
4. **Unlimited widgets**<br>
   Flutter includes an incredible set of widgets for your app’s UI interface. And the best thing about this set of 
   widgets is that all of them are easily customizable and reusable.
5. **Exceptional performances**<br>
   Flutter is popular for its incredible performance and the ability to master it pretty quickly. Thanks to Dart - its 
   programming language, it features a high-speed frame rate.
   This approach allows developers to reach a wider audience without significant costs. Additionally, it reduces the 
   time spent on development compared to developing separate apps for each platform.
6. **Hot Reload feature**<br>
   Hot Reload is another incredible feature that the Flutter framework has. It means your developer can instantly change
   and update your app and see the result. It is a feature that lets you place an updated source code into a running app
   without waiting for the app to rebuild or relaunch.
7. **Automated testing**<br>
   Application testing needs time and money investment. However, you can simplify and ease this work by using Flutter as 
   your cross-platform app development platform. Furthermore, automated testing, which Flutter features, allows developers 
   to quickly validate the app's usability, functionality, and user interface.

## Why is Flutter the Future of Mobile App Development?

* **Growing demand for cross-platform frameworks** - Flutter is a great option for businesses and developers searching 
  for methods to reach a broader audience. Also, it reduces development costs due to its ability to produce apps for many 
  platforms using a single codebase.
* **Importance of mobile widgets** - The role of widgets is becoming even more significant as the mobile app development 
  market grows. This makes Flutter a great choice for developers wishing to create creative, aesthetically appealing apps.
* **Demand for Dart programming language** - Dart is gaining popularity because of its simplicity and ease of usage. 
   Thus, more and more developers are opting for Flutter.
* **The high growth of the Flutter community** - The Flutter community is fast expanding and contributing to the 
  framework's progress. With more developers contributing to Flutter, additional features, tools, and libraries are 
  introduced, making Flutter more powerful and adaptable.
* **Rise of the Internet of Things (IoT)** - With a growing number of IoT devices, there is an increasing demand for 
  application developers who can build apps that can interface with these devices. Flutter's compatibility with numerous 
  devices and platforms makes it ideal for this application development.

## Conclusion
If you are in doubt about whether to hire a Flutter developer or not, here’s your solution. If you want reduced time and 
cost for creating your app with the highest performance and fast time to market, choose Flutter.
Its community is growing by the minute, with constant updates, assistance, and new practices. The future of Flutter 
development is here, and it is in such demand that it is not going down but rather getting bigger every day.
